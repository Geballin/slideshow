Slideshow
===

Draw a slideshow with the images in a directory or listed in a file and show it in a window or fullscreen.
This is the perfect tool for seeing pictures from a directory when you are in a terminal : keyboard driven, quick, easy to use.

It can render a lot of picture format (bmp, jpeg, png...).

## Installation

    ./configure
    make
    make install
(sudo make install if you're not root)

## Usage

Just type `slideshow` in a directory where you have pictures.

## Documentation

You can see the help screen using `man slideshow` or `slideshow -h`


For exemple, to draw all pictures on the actual directory recursively in a window with auto advance every 3 seconds just type `slideshow -recurse -window advance 3`
